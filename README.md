This is where my Capstone Project will live!

My project is to create a virtual dance studio platform where dance instructors can publish their own schedules, host class content and live class integration. Students are able to register for current class offerings, and access personalized pages with content for each class. 

My goal is to start here and eventually build it out so that the platform can be used by studios and dance festivals as a way to stream-line the current situation of having to set up google calendars/calendarly, create zoom accounts/links, set up paypal, send content via dropbox/drive, etc! This will give the dance industry a one stop shop for all their virtual needs.
